# Emobot 

Emotion is an interactive bot built using IBM's Watson API and will alllow elders to communicate with an AI with which they can play games such as Rock, Paper, Scissors and more. A tone analyzer will also be ran on the elder's replies after which if the tone is deemed to be too sad, angry or fearful then an automatic SMS text message will be triggered and sent to a relative of the older to suggest him/her to contact his loved one.
